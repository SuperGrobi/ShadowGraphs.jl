# Projecting Shadow Graphs
## Introduction
We extend the functionality of (`CoolWalksUtils.jl`)[https://github.com/SuperGrobi/CoolWalksUtils.jl] with functions to project all the `ArchGDAL` geometry attached to nodes and edges into a transverse mercator projection, to do geometric operations on them.
